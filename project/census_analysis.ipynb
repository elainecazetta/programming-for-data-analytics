    "This project analyses population, housing, and immigration trends in Ireland using Census data from 2006, 2011, 2016, and 2022. The aim is to examine how population growth and changes in immigration relate to housing availability across Irish counties. The analysis focuses on identifying long-term trends and regional differences using official data published by the [Central Statistics Office (CSO)](https://www.cso.ie/en/index.html)."

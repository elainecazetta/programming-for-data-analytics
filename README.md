# Programming for Data Analytics 

This repository contains my work for the **Programming for Data Analytics** module, part of the Science in Computing (Data Analytics) course at [Atlantic Technological University (ATU)](https://www.atu.ie/). 
Lecturer: [Andrew Beatty](https://github.com/andrewbeattycourseware/andrewbeattycourseware). 

The module focuses on developing Python programming and data analytics skills, including data retrieval, cleaning, analysis, visualization, and the use of libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **scikit-learn**.
